<p style="margin: 0px; font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 11px; padding-bottom: 10px; color: #7b7b7b; line-height: normal;">Tai Chi for Osteoporosis is a program designed by Dr Paul Lam in conjunction with his Tai Chi associates and a team of medical experts. This program is designed with consideration to available medical evidence to improve balance and prevent falls. It will also improve relaxation, fitness and health. Certified instructors must have attended a workshop, possess the suitable qualifications and fulfil the requirements including passing a written test, and update their certification every two years. Instructors are trained to teach this program safely and effectively to people with or without osteoporosis.</p>
